# avahi-daemon(8) configuration file

# By default, all devices have the same hostname ("localhost") which
# means that avahi-daemon(8) will set the LAN name 'linux'. So if
# there's more than one ChromeOS device on the LAN, renaming will
# occur and this is costly as it potentially involves O(n^2)
# renames. We avoid this situation by simply using the machine-id as
# the name.
