# Environment variable for the mount point of the rtanalytics library .so
# component to be loaded by the executable.
# TODO(chromium:835974): should be capitalized as MOUNT_POINT. Note: This
# requires a change in the chrome.mediaPerceptionPrivate implementation.

# Below are used minijail0 arguments and their meaning:
# -e: process doesn't need network access
# -N: process doesn't need to modify control groups settings
# -p -r: process doesn't need to access other processes in the system
# -v: process doesn't need access to user mounts
# -l: process doesn't use SysV shared memory or IPC
# -u -g: run under user and group
# -n: process doesn't need new privileges
# -S: use seccomp policy restrictions
