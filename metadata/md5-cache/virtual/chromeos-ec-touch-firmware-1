DESCRIPTION=Generic ebuild which satisfies virtual/chromeos-ec-touch-firmware. This is a direct dependency of chromeos-base/chromeos-ec, and can be overridden in an overlay for each specialized board, if a touch FW needs to be provided to the EC build system at compile time (e.g. to generate hashes to be included in RW section).
