<longdescription>
	The chromeos-cr50 package retrieves the offical cr50 firmware as a blob from
	the binary component server (BCS). Note that the board overlay must define the
	"cr50_onboard" USE flag for the FW to be included in the build for the device.
</longdescription>
<use>
	<flag name='cr50_onboard'>
		In order for the cr50 firmware to be included in a board image, its
		configuration must specify this flag. The flag is required for installing
		the package itself as a safeguared against accidental inclusion on a system.
	</flag>
