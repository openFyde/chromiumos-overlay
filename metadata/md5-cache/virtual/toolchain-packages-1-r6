DESCRIPTION=Virtual package for listing toolchain packages. All packages which should be considered part of the toolchain must be directly listed as dependencies of this package. The common features of packages that should be in this virtual are packages that consumed by many other packages (to the point of needing to rebuild a significant chunk of the world to properly test changes) and that don't fit nicely in to Portage's dependency model (for bootstrap problems/circular dependencies/other reasons).
