# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# This is unloved by mesa, and should never be pulled into the targets.
# It is actually for clang and ASAN that we want to have edge versions.
# This should be kept in sync with package.keywords.
