This package resides here because the ebuild file deviates significantly from
the upstream version, as it points to a later tagged version. This was done
because the latest version available through Gentoo has a bug. If a new version
is available upstream that works for ChromeOS, this package can be moved back to
`portage-stable`. If major deviation from upstream is needed, this package can
continue to live here.
