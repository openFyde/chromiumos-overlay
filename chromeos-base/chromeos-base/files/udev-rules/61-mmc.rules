# eMMC devices queue features are not currently supported, so the IO queue
# length is 2.
# Leaving the IO scheduler queue length at 128 mean up to 126 IOs can be
# sitting in the queue. An IO can sit up to 4s in the queue.
# Instead, reduce the IO scheduler queue length to 32, putting processes that
# read or write to sleep earlier.
# 30 IOs are more than enough for finding merging candidates.
