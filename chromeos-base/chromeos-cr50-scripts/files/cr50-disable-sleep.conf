# This upstrat script just starts cr50-disable-sleep.sh, which monitors dbus
# for suspend events and then sends a command to the Cr50 to disable
# deep sleep during suspend.
#
# Keeping Cr50 awake during suspend consumes slightly moore power, but
# significantly improves resume time.
#
# This upstart script will only be installed when the
# `cr50_disable_sleep_in_suspend` USE flag is set
