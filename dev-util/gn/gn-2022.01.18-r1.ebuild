# When the time comes to roll to a new version, download the new gn binary at
# https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/p/gn/gn/linux-amd64/+/
# and run `gn --version` to get the right version number for the ebuild.
# Once you do so, push the gn binary to gs://chromeos-localmirror/distfiles
# and be sure to mark it publicly visible:
#  gsutil cp gn gs://chromeos-localmirror/distfiles/gn-<SHA1>.bin
#  gsutil acl set public-read gs://chromeos-localmirror/distfiles/gn-<SHA1>.bin
#
# Then rename the PV of ebuild file to the date (YYYY.MM.DD) of the
# corresponding commit of the upstream since the upstream doesn't have a
# numeric version format currently.
#
# After that, update GN_X64_SHA1 below with the SHA1 of the gn binary.
# Finally, run `ebuild <ebuild file name> manifest` to generate the Manifest
# file.
