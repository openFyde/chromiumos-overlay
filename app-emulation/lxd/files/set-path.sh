# Append lxd-next paths to PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#
# We have to do this both here and in maitred for three reasons:
#  1) vshd is started before the StartTermina RPC, so it's environment variables
#     don't reflect information about which LXD should be used
#  2) /etc/profile adds the "normal" PATH entries *before* existing PATH values,
#     whereas we need the lxd-next paths to come first, so even if vshd did have
#     a correct PATH the resulting login shell wouldn't.
#  3) vshd clears the environment before exec anyway
#
# This file is installed as a dot-file in /etc/bash/bashrc.d/ (which will be
# ignored) and bind-mounted over an empty file in the same directory if it is
# needed.
