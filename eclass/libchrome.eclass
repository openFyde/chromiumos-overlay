# @BLURB: helper eclass for managing dependencies on libchrome
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Our base library libchrome is slotted and is used by a lot of packages. All
# the version numbers need to be updated whenever we uprev libchrome. This
# eclass centralizes the logic used to depend on libchrome and sets up the
# environment variables to reduce the amount of change needed.

inherit cros-debug libchrome-version

# Require a recent one from time to time to help keep people up-to-date.
