Subject: [PATCH 05/19] Be more permissive on NAKs

Previously, we'd reject NAKs that did not include a server ID.
Since we'd only check that a server ID was present, but did not
validate it against any stored state, the test is merely pedantic.
Moreover, some DHCP servers (e.g. OpenBSD 4.6) send NAK messages
without a server ID. [1]

To improve compatibility with real-world DHCP servers, drop the
check for the presence of a server ID.
