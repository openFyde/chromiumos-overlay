# ffmpeg-5.1.1-r2 depends on `VK_EXT_VIDEO_DECODE_H264_EXTENSION_NAME` which
# does not exist in `vulkan-headers-1.3.239` because it has been promoted to
# `VK_KHR_VIDEO_DECODE_H264_EXTENSION_NAME`.
# To avoid a build issue in ffmpeg, let's just disable the usage of vulkan in
# ffmpeg as it does not need it at the moment.
