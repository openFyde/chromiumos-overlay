# A note about this ebuild: this ebuild is Unified Build enabled but
# not in the way in which most other ebuilds with Unified Build
# knowledge are: the primary use for this ebuild is for engineer-local
# work or firmware builder work. In both cases, the build might be
# happening on a branch in which only one of many of the models are
# available to build. The logic in this ebuild succeeds so long as one
# of the many models successfully builds.

# Increment the "eclass bug workaround count" below when you change
# "cros-ec.eclass" to work around https://issuetracker.google.com/201299127.
#
# eclass bug workaround count: 8
