# WAF (the build system used by Samba projects) only supports cross-compilation
# using an "answers" file.
#
# This file contains the config options that WAF can not determine without
# execution of a sample program on the target platform. The majority of other
# configure options can be determined through compilation tests alone.
#
# In the case that these values need to be checked for a new platform, the
# string before the colon can be searched for in the files wscript* in the
# Samba code. This will be the 'msg' argument to a call to CHECK_CODE. The
# first argument to CHECK_CODE will be a small C code snippet.
#
# In some cases the result can be determined by observation. For example
# where it is known that the behavior only occurs on certain legacy platforms
# or versions. In other cases the code snippet can be temporarily added to any
# other convenient executable for an ad hoc test.
