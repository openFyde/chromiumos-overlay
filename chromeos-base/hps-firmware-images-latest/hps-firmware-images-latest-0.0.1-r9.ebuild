	# Compress firmware images to save space. hpsd will decompress these on the fly.
	# hpsd limits decompression memory to 20MiB. xz(1) explains:
	# "The settings used when compressing a file determine the memory
	# requirements of the decompressor.  Typically the decompressor needs
	# 5 % to 20 % of the amount of memory that the compressor needed when
	# creating the file." Thus we apply a limit of 80MiB when compressing.
