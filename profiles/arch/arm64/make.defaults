# 64 bit arm was first introduced in v8, so we can guarantee that we will ta least have v8.
# Arm V9 uses ARM v8.5 as a baseline, and so setting the CPU flags to v8 *should* be ok.
# ARMv8-A makes VFPv3/v4 and advanced SIMD (Neon) standard
# Note: Not all arm64 chips support 32 bit mode (AArch32), but all the ones we use do.
# AArch32 mode provides backwards compatability with v7
# ARM v7 is backwards compatible with v6, and requires support for thumb2.
