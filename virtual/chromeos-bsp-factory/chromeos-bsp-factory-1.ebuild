DESCRIPTION="Generic ebuild which satisifies virtual/chromeos-bsp-factory.
This is a direct dependency of chromeos-base/factory, but is expected
to be overridden in an overlay for each specialized board.  A typical
non-generic implementation will install any board-specific configuration
files and drivers which are not suitable for inclusion in a generic board
overlay."
