DESCRIPTION="Generic ebuild which satisifies virtual/service-manager.
This is a direct dependency of chromeos-base/chromeos, but can
be overridden in an overlay for specialized boards.

To satisfy this virtual, a package should cause to be installed everything
required to bring the system up and start managing system services."
