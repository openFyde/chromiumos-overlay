DESCRIPTION=Metapackage that provides the implicit system dependencies of anything CrOS-ish. These are things like 'mv', 'ls', 'mkfs', 'a shell', 'c libraries', users and groups, SSL certs, etc. If every package had to specify them, it'd be onerous and also difficult to replace them with other functional equivalents. Developers should assume that this metapackage supplies functionality roughly equivalent to a POSIX-compliant system. Each package we include here has justification provided inline. For further reference, see POSIX (1003.1-2008): http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html FHS: http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html Other than the standard C and C++ libraries (libc, libpthreads, libstdc++, etc), if you're linking against a library that happens to be installed by a package listed here, you MUST also depend on the appropriate package. Exclusions: compression utils, e.g. tar/bzip2/gzip: at this time, we don't store data compressed on the rootfs, and don't expect users to be interacting on the command line. If your daemon needs functionality like this, ideally you'd use a library that implements this functionality and not command-line tools. iputils: ping et al are helpful diagnostic tools, but not required for normal system function.
