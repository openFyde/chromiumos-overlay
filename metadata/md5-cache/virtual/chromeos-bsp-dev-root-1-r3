DESCRIPTION=Generic ebuild which satisfies virtual/chromeos-bsp-dev-root. This is a direct dependency of chromeos-base/chromeos-dev-root, but is expected to be overridden in an overlay for each specialized board. A typical non-generic implementation will install any board-specific developer only files and executables which are not suitable for inclusion on the root partition in a generic board overlay.
