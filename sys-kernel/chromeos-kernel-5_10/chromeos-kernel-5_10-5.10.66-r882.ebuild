DESCRIPTION="Chrome OS Linux Kernel 5.10"
KEYWORDS="*"

# Change the following (commented out) number to the next prime number
# when you change "cros-kernel2.eclass" to work around http://crbug.com/220902
#
# NOTE: There's nothing magic keeping this number prime but you just need to
# make _any_ change to this file.  ...so why not keep it prime?
#
# Don't forget to update the comment in _all_ chromeos-kernel-x_x-9999.ebuild
# files (!!!)
#
# The coolest prime number is: 179
