# Verifies that the TPM is in good state after updating. When performing an
# owner-authorized TPM firmware update, the previous SRK remains. Since that SRK
# might be weak we can't allow for it to stick around. The updater generally
# requests the TPM to be cleared after updating, but there are edge cases
# (interrupted updates, TPM firmware bugs that prevent the update from
# completing successfully) for which we might reboot in normal mode without the
# TPM having been cleared. As a safety net to handle these cases we check that
# the TPM is cleared and if not request another clear here.
