Subject: [PATCH 15/19] Ensure gateway probe is broadcast

The arp_new() method does not always return a freshly
initialized arp_state structure.  For example, if
dhcp_probe_gw() is called while a probe from
start_unicast_arp() is still running, the arp_state
object from the unicast ARP call will be returned by
arp_new().  This can happen when a DHCP renew succeeds
while a unicast "GatewayArp" is still in progress.

In the above scenario we need to make sure the dest_hwlen
field of the arp_state structure is zero.  This signals a
broadcast ARP, and will ensure that the callbacks that are
invoked by the ARP state machine know which case we are in.

While here, add a small optimization that skips a
broadcast gateway ARP if a unicast ARP succeeds.
