Subject: [PATCH] client: add distribution module major version

Upstream docker does not yet support Go modules but in ChromeOS
we want to enable modules across the tree. Doing this is
relatively straightforward in projects, we just need to
update the import paths to respect module requirements.

The main requirement docker upstream does not respect is
adding the major version of dependencies as suffixes in
the import paths. For github.com/docker/distribution the
major version suffix is v2.

Fixing all docker code to properly support modules is a
much bigger effort, but this is enough to get ChromeOS
working. This patch should be dropped when docker finally
supports modules.
