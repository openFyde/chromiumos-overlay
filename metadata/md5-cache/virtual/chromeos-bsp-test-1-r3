DESCRIPTION=Generic ebuild which satisifies virtual/chromeos-bsp-test. This is a direct dependency of virtual/target-chromium-os-test, but is expected to be overridden in an overlay for each specialized board. A typical non-generic implementation will install any board-specific test-only files and executables which are not suitable for inclusion in a generic board overlay.
