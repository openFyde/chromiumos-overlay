# @BLURB: helper eclass for building Chromium OS release firmware
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Release firmware using the EC code base needs to be built from specific
# branches/commits and must be signed by the signing daemon. This eclass
# provides a standardized mechanism for that process by building for a specific
# EC "board" and installing it into /build/<board>/<FPMCU_board>/release
# so that the signer can pick it up. Note that this doesn't install the
# firmware into the rootfs; that has to be done by a separate ebuild since the
# signer runs after the build.
#
# NOTE: When making changes to this class, make sure to modify all the -9999
# ebuilds that inherit it (e.g., chromeos-fpmcu-release*) to work around
# http://crbug.com/220902.
