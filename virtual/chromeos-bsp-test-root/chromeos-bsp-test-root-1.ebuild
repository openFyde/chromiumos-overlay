DESCRIPTION="Generic ebuild which satisfies virtual/chromeos-bsp-test-root.
This package is merged onto the rootfs when an image is modified for test.  A
typical non-generic implementation will install any board-specific test-only
files which are required on the rootfs (such as upstart jobs) but which are not
suitable for inclusion in a generic board overlay."
