# A functionally similar binary can be created from AOSP source tree with

#     ART_BUILD_HOST_STATIC=true ART_BUILD_HOST_NDEBUG=true mmma art/dex2oat
# We do not build it from source because of size and complexity of pulling
# down a big portion of AOSP source tree.

# For P, the binary was copied from:

# For RVC, the binary is build from rvc-arc-dev art commit
