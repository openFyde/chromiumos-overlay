# 1) Normally, test image packages are merged into the stateful partition
# 2) Some test packages require files in the root file system (e.g.
#    upstart jobs must live in /etc/init).
# 3) There's an extra emerge command for this package in
#    build_library/test_image_util.sh that specifically merges this
#    package into the root before merging the remaining test packages
#    into stateful.
